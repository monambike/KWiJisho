# Getting Started

To set up the bot you need to provide some Token values in the config.json file or at the system Environment Variables.

# Make the Documentation

The documentation is made with [DocFX](https://github.com/dotnet/docfx).

To create the website files and host them you can use the command: `docfx docfx.json --serve`.

If encountered any problems or issues, you may need first to go to the `docs` folders and then run the command `docfx build` before.
