## Why KWiJisho?

KWiJisho it's pronounced and stands for "Kawaii" and "Jisho" that means "Cute" and "Dictionary" in japanese respectively. I played with the words like this because the main objective for creating this bot was because it would have a custom dictionary feature.

I left this name because it was the main motivation of creating this bot, and even founding an alternative solution to solve this problem it's a catchy name so I still with it!
