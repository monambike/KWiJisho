# Introduction

Fun and friendly interactive Discord bot with a wide range of functions.

KWiJisho stands for "Kawaii" and "Jisho" that means "Cute" and "Dictionary" in japanese respectively. I played with the words like this because the main objective for creating this bot was because it would have a custom dictionary feature.
