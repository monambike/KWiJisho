The prefix command format is `!sendNews "{title}" "{description}" true`.

Please, take in mind:
- You can attach an image to the message and it will be sent with the news, if you attach more than one, only the first one will be sent;
- You need to put that true at the end so it doesn't get sent to my test server! :)
[This command can only be executed by people with the "administrator" permission]
